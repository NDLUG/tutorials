1. Make sure you have Python3 installed (if `$ which python3` does not output anything, its not installed)
  - To install on Mac, use Homebrew (download it if you do not already have it)
    - Then, you can use `$ brew install python3`
  - To install on Linux, use whatever package manager you have (e.g. `$ sudo apt install python3`)
  - To install on Windows, I think you can download via the app store (need to check)
2. Run `$ python3 -m pip install flask`
3. Run the server using `$ python3 app.py`
